Adaptive Agentic RAG Engine

A decision-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that prioritizes document-grounded responses and intelligently falls back to web search when necessary. Built using LangGraph orchestration, FAISS vector retrieval, OpenAI embeddings, and Tavily search — with a Streamlit interface for interactive querying.
